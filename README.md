## Introduction

I love my dogs alot (like alot-alot) and as such I'm creating a project utilizing HTML, CSS, Javascript elements to show off all my doggos!

I plan to expand this project into each; Python Flask app, React app and Java app that will allow people to upload their own content about their doggos! Fun! 

[Watch](https://github.com/chrisforee/DoggoAlbum#:~:text=All-,Activity,-Notified%20of%20all) and [Star](https://github.com/chrisforee/DoggoAlbum/stargazers) this repo as I'll post updates for all expansions here as well as in their respective repos!
